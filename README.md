# Phaser Space Shooter
Learn how to create a game with Phaser JS, an easy to use and free Javascript / HTML5 game engine.

This is open-source and licensed under the DWUW or DO WHATEVER U WANT license. You can copy and use it in any way you like. I really don't care.


#Approach:
This is for beginners, so we broke each key step down to different JS file. You can cut and paste the lines of code step by step and run your game to see how each step works. 

We try to build a good foundation of concepts so that you can enhance your game development skills in future tutorials. From the onset, we keep all our JS code on JS files instead of inline scripts in the HTML file. We assume you have no knowledge of HTML, so just focus on the JS stuff. The HTML stuff is set up already so no need to mess around too much with it. :)

#Getting Started:
Phaser requires a web server to run the game properly. There are several options to get one if you are new.

You can install PHP or Python on your system and start your local server from the directory of your game.
Wha?? Too much hassle?

Ok, a simpler way is to sign up for an account at cloud9 or c9.io, then clone this repository. Copy and paste the URL into the part of the page  where you create a new workspace in Cloud9.

##Have fun!
